#following code is for asking for user information
name = input("What is your name? : ")
age = input("What is your age? : ")

#this code will display the information
print("Hello", name, "you are",age,"years old and you are in year", yearlevel)

'''This is my next change for asking user details in the previous program
the name accepted numbers and age and yearlevel accepted string.
I will create the proper datatypes so that name will acept only strings and age and year level.'''
